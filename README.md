# Air and Water Quality Management using Machine Learning

## üß™ Project Overview

This project develops a predictive analytics model to assess and monitor environmental quality, specifically focusing on air and water quality. Leveraging machine learning techniques, it processes real-time sensor data to provide insights into pollution levels and supports informed decision-making for environmental protection and public health. This system is designed to identify trends, predict potential issues, and visualize critical environmental parameters.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Data Integration:** Processes sensor data for air pollutants (e.g., CO, CO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5) and water contaminants (e.g., pH, turbidity, temperature).
* **Predictive Analytics:** Implements machine learning models (e.g., Regression, Classification) to predict future air and water quality based on historical and real-time data.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates interactive plots and charts to visualize environmental trends, anomalies, and current quality status.
* **Environmental Insights:** Provides actionable insights for individuals, industries, and government agencies to track pollution levels and take preventive actions.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to be adaptable for integration with IoT devices and cloud platforms for continuous monitoring.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** For static data visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For enhanced statistical data visualizations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models (regression, classification).
* **TensorFlow:** For building and training more complex predictive models (e.g., neural networks), if applicable.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization (often where the core logic resides).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bagchiarindam2022/Air_and_Water_Quality_Index_and_Environmental_Monitoring.git](https://github.com/bagchiarindam2022/Air_and_Water_Quality_Index_and_Environmental_Monitoring.git)
    cd Air_and_Water_Quality_Index_and_Environmental_Monitoring
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window with the Jupyter environment. Navigate to the relevant `.ipynb` files (e.g., `air_quality_analysis.ipynb`, `water_quality_prediction.ipynb`).

## üìä Usage

Once the environment is set up and the notebooks are running:

1.  **Explore the Data:** Open the notebooks to understand the data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps.
2.  **Train Models:** Run the cells related to model training and evaluation. You can experiment with different parameters and algorithms.
3.  **Visualize Results:** Observe the generated plots and insights to understand the environmental quality trends and predictions.
4.  **Adapt for New Data:** The code is structured to allow for easy integration of new sensor data. Modify the data loading and preprocessing sections as needed for your specific dataset.
